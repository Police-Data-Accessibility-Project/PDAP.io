      <h3>We can't fix what we can't measure.</h3>
      <p>
        The ability of police systems to impact people's lives demands a higher
        degree of scrutiny regarding their fairness. Right now, it is hard to
        answer the most basic questions about most police agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        We work toward better shared access to data about our police system.
        This is the foundation of any research, advocacy, journalism,
        accountability, or reform.
