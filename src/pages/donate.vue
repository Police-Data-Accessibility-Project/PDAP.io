      <h3>We can't fix what we can't measure.</h3>
      <p>
        The ability of police systems to impact people's lives demands a higher
        degree of scrutiny regarding their fairness. Right now, it is hard to
        answer the most basic questions about most police agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        We work toward better shared access to data about our police system.
        This is the foundation of any research, advocacy, journalism,
        accountability, or reform.
      </p>
      <h3>We're making tools that will outlive our organization.</h3>
      <p>
        Our work is open-source, meaning any progress we make on our software is shared 
        with the public, and will outlive our organization. 
        It can apply to any kind of public data, in sectors outside policing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of our money goes toward staff and contractor time to advance our software 
        for finding and sharing data. Some goes toward hosting our app and data. 
        The remainder goes toward operations.
      </p>
      <h3>How our paid staff spend their time</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-4">
        <li>Building software to help people find data and answer questions.</li>
        <li>Connecting skilled volunteers and collaborators with impactful projects.</li>
        <li>Sharing best practices for publishing data with people who work in local government.</li>
