          <h2>People</h2>
          <p>Every local police system has people studying it&mdash;this is the community that created PDAP.</p>
          <p>We're headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA. We have paid staff and volunteers from around the United States and beyond.</p>
          <p>The board is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eddie-johnbrown/">Eddie&nbsp;Brown</a>, <a
              href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wakin/">Alec&nbsp;Akin</a>, and <a
              href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshlintag/">Josh&nbsp;Lintag</a>.</p>
          <p>Our Executive Director is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-chamberlain/">Josh Chamberlain</a>.</p>

      <h2>Operating principles</h2>
      <p>We create tools to help people work with local data: police systems are locally operated, 
        and records need to be in their original context to be understood.</p>
      <p>We are not creating a massive, interoperable database. This data is most useful in a local context,
        and this is a defense mechanism against aggregating data about criminalized people.</p>
      <p>The people impacted by a local agency know best which public records are important and how they should be accessed.</p>
      <p>We are only interested in solutions which could survive the collapse of our organization. Our work is
        open-source, and our planning is transparent.</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <h3>What kind of data do you collect?<br></h3>
      <p>Anything published by or about a criminal legal system agency: courts, jails, and law enforcement (police). You
        can read more about <a href="https://docs.pdap.io/activities/data-sources/what-is-a-data-source">what a Data
          Source is</a> in our docs.<br></p>
      <h3>Who is this data for?<br></h3>
      <p>Everybody! Public records are for all of us.</p>
      <h3>Why are you different from police watchdog groups?<br></h3>
      <p>Our activism is data collection and accessibility. We aren't targeting "bad apples." We're documenting local
        systems for the benefit of anyone who believes they are worth studying.<br></p>
      <h3>Is this legal?</h3>
      <p>Yes. We're consolidating public information, in accordance with <a
          href="https://docs.pdap.io/meta/legal">established legal precedents</a>.<br></p>
      <h3>Are you affiliated with a political party?<br></h3>
      <p>No. Our only motivation is to provide better access to public records in an age of disinformation. Our members
        have diverse perspectives and goals for police institutions, but we are united by the common goal of
        transparency.<br></p>
