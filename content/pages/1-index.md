            text: Law enforcement data, especially at the local level, is hidden in the corners of the internet, obfuscated by bureaucracy, and served up via low quality user experiences. All this makes it difficult for citizens to access, consolidate, and make use of the data for accurate and factual inferences. Our approach empowers volunteer hunter-gatherers to contribute to a platform empowering the citizenry with oversight capability.

            text: Our platform is a consolidated, publicly available library of law enforcement related records. Our goal is to ease data consumption, facilitate open source software analytics, and provide an interface for reporting and analysis of law enforcement activity. Our platform will be made publicly available, free of charge.
          - type: paragraph
            text: Our target user demographic is the data analytics and justice sector so they may examine law enforcement trends. The platform will also benefit broader swathes of the population, such as academics studies, press coverage, government oversight, elected officials, and the law enforcement agencies themselves.
